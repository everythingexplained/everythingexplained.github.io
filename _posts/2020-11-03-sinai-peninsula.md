The Suez canal, connecting the Meditteranean and the Red sea through the gulf of Suez, is to the West of Sinai. Mount Sinai, where Moses is said to have received the Ten Commandmends lies here.

In the past, Sinai Peninsula has been occupied multiple times by Israel. In 1982, Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula as a result of the Egypt-Israel peace treaty.
